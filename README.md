# Pokemon Match
Pokemon teams are often built around a group of two or three Pokemon that share
attributes beneficial to each other. This group of two or three Pokemon is called
a team core. For further details about cores read Smogons' 
[Guide to Three-type Cores](https://www.smogon.com/smog/issue43/three-type-cores).
Typing synergy is one important factor in constructing team cores. The program 
pkmn_match, matches either two or three Pokemon based on their typing synergy
from user-specified parameters.
